## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Fetch API and JSON

### What I learned

I have created the entire colored button container with all its elements using JavaScript and retrieved the data
from the JSON file using the Fetch API with asynchronous code. For the styling of the elements I used CSS.

I've learned how to create elements and set classes with JavaScript. Also I've learned how to fetch data from
JSON and how to implement this data in newly created elements.
